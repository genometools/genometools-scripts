# genometools-scripts

This repository contains scripts written in the Lua language using the
GenomeTools [Lua bindings](http://genometools.org/docs.html). This API makes
it quite easy to process GFF3 annotations and connect them to the corresponding
sequences.

Please look at `gt-TEMPLATE` for an example of how to write these scripts.
